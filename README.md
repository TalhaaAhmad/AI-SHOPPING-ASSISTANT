## üí¨ WhatsApp Integration

The platform supports seamless WhatsApp integration for real-time customer support and AI-powered conversations.

### Key Features:
- **Receive WhatsApp Messages**: Incoming WhatsApp messages (text and images) are processed by the AI agent.
- **AI Response**: The AI generates a response and sends it back to the user via WhatsApp.
- **Persistent Chat History**: All WhatsApp conversations are stored in Convex, maintaining full history for each contact.
- **Image Support**: Images sent via WhatsApp are processed and can be used for product identification, complaints, and more.
- **Admin Dashboard**: View and search all WhatsApp conversations, see message history (including images), and manage chats from the admin panel.
- **Search & Pagination**: Easily search and paginate through WhatsApp chats in the admin dashboard.

### How It Works:
1. **Webhook Endpoint**: WhatsApp messages are sent to the `/api/chat/stream/whatsapp` endpoint.
2. **Message Processing**: The message (and any image) is processed by the AI agent, with full chat history for context.
3. **Response Delivery**: The AI's response is sent back to the user on WhatsApp using the configured API.
4. **History Storage**: Both user and AI messages (with metadata and images) are stored in Convex for future reference.
5. **Admin View**: Admins can view all WhatsApp chats, search by contact, and see full message history (including images) in the dashboard.

### How to Test/Use:
- **Send a WhatsApp message** to the configured webhook endpoint (see `app/api/chat/stream/whatsapp/route.ts`).
- **Check the Admin Dashboard**: Go to the WhatsApp tab to view all conversations, search, and paginate.
- **View Message Details**: Click "View Chat" to see the full message history, including images.

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture & Patterns

### **Frontend**
- **Next.js 14 App Router**: Modern routing, layouts, server/client split
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **Components**: Modular, reusable, and colocated with features

### **Authentication**
- **Clerk**: Handles sign up, sign in, user sessions, and admin checks

### **Backend**
- **Convex**: Real-time database, queries, and mutations for orders, complaints, products, etc.
- **API Routes**: For chat, streaming, and order management

### **AI Tools**
- Modular tools in `/tools/` for product search, order management, complaint handling, etc.
- System messages and tool instructions in `/constants/`

### **Admin Dashboard**
- **Server/Client Layout Split**:  
  - `layout.tsx` (server): Exports metadata, renders client layout  
  - `[Section]LayoutClient.tsx` (client): Handles sidebar, navigation, user info, etc.

---

## üîí Security

- Only users with IDs in `ADMIN_USER_IDS` can access admin routes.
- All admin pages are protected and show an access denied message for unauthorized users.
- API routes and backend logic are protected by authentication and authorization checks.

---

## üìù Customization

- **Navigation:**  Edit the `navigation` array in each client layout to add/remove sections.
- **Styling:**  Uses Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development. Customize in `app/globals.css` or component classes.
- **Backend:**  All data operations are handled via Convex functions in `convex/`.
- **System Messages:**  Update tool instructions and system prompts in `constants/systemMessage.ts`.
